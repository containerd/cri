CRI Plugin Testing Guide
========================
This document assumes you have already setup the development environment (go, git, `containerd/cri` repo etc.).

Before sending pull requests you should at least make sure your changes have passed code verification, unit, integration and CRI validation tests.
## Code Verification
Code verification includes lint, code formatting, boilerplate check etc.
* Install tools used by code verification:
```bash
make install.tools
```
* Run code verification:
```bash
make verify
```
## Unit Test
Run all unit tests in `containerd/cri` repo.
```bash
make test
```
## Integration Test
Run all integration tests in `containerd/cri` repo.
* [Install dependencies](../README.md#install-dependencies).
* Run integration test:
```bash
make test-integration
```
## CRI Validation Test
[CRI validation test](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/cri-validation.md) is a test framework for validating that a Container Runtime Interface (CRI) implementation such as containerd with the `cri` plugin meets all the requirements necessary to manage pod sandboxes, containers, images etc.

CRI validation test makes it possible to verify CRI conformance of `containerd/cri` without setting up Kubernetes components or running Kubernetes end-to-end tests.
* [Install dependencies](../README.md#install-dependencies).
* Build containerd with the `cri` plugin:
```bash
make
```
* Run CRI validation test:
```bash
make test-cri
```
* Focus or skip specific CRI validation test:
```bash
make test-cri FOCUS=REGEXP_TO_FOCUS SKIP=REGEXP_TO_SKIP
```
[More information](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/cri-tools) about CRI validation test.
## Node E2E Test
[Node e2e test](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/e2e-node-tests.md) is a test framework testing Kubernetes node level functionalities such as managing pods, mounting volumes etc. It starts a local cluster with Kubelet and a few other minimum dependencies, and runs node functionality tests against the local cluster.
* [Install dependencies](../README.md#install-dependencies).
* Run node e2e test:
```bash
make test-e2e-node
```
* Focus or skip specific node e2e test:
```bash
make test-e2e-node FOCUS=REGEXP_TO_FOCUS SKIP=REGEXP_TO_SKIP
```
