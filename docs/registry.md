# Configure Image Registry
This document describes the method to configure the image registry for `containerd` for use with the `cri` plugin.

With containerd, `docker.io` is the default image registry. You can also set up other image registries similar to docker.

To configure image registries create/modify the `/etc/containerd/config.toml` as follows:
```toml
[plugins.cri.registry.mirrors]
  [plugins.cri.registry.mirrors."docker.io"]
    endpoint = ["https://registry-1.docker.io"]
  [plugins.cri.registry.mirrors."test.secure-registry.io"]
    endpoint = ["https://HostIP1:Port1"]
  [plugins.cri.registry.mirrors."test.insecure-registry.io"]
    endpoint = ["http://HostIP2:Port2"]
```

The default configuration can be generated by `containerd config default > /etc/containerd/config.toml`.

The endpoint is a list that can contain multiple image registry URLs splited by commas.

After modify the config file, you need restart the `containerd` service.
